# Sprint 1 - Retrospective

## What went well and what not? 
* __Not well__: 
    * Time spent working was not evenly spread over the days between sprints
    * We should've considered making sure tasks didn't rely on each other becuase it caused blocks from the start
* __Well__: 
    * We brainstormed and determined our project's development and ideal final version quickly
    * We figured out issues with BitBucket and GitKraken quickly and as a team

* __Caden__ : I successfully integrated with the Spotify API and helped the team become more familiar with Git.
* __Devin__ : Something that went well for me was being able to communicate with and recieve updates from team members through Slack. 
* __Jacob__ :
* __Leon__  : Some things that went well for me was able to learn new tools as well as getting more familiar with my team and our work flow.
* __Mateo__ : After receiving help from my teammates on how to connect VSCode with GitKraken, I was successfully able to complete all of my tasks. The main thing that didn't go well for me was connecting my VSCode to GitKraken to commit my changes. 



## What might be impending us from performing better?
* Familiarity with each other and the tools we use. Especially using Git effectively.

## What can I do to improve?
* __Caden__ : I unintentionally complicated things when I completed part of Leon’s task, as I was relying on his code. In the future, just do my task and create a PR when it is done, 
* __Devin__ : I need to make sure to reach out to team members to get help understanding their code (if I'm modifying/referencing it) before starting a task.
* __Jacob__ :
* __Leon__  : I can work on improving my ability to write clean, efficient code and ensuring clear communication with the team when tasks are completed using Git.
* __Mateo__ : I would say definitely not be afraid to ask my teammates for help/questions since I got most of my work done later than I wouldv've liked because I was hesistant to ask them for help. When I did, things went really well for me. In the future, I need to improve on asking them for help if I need it.


## AI
### Description of how AI (ChatGPT, Anthropic, Genesis, etc) assisted the team during the semester.
* AI assissted our team by providing a resource that could generate information and responses based directly on our project, not just general information. This made it useful and directly applicable to certain issues we encountered. 
### At least 3 specific examples of what AI was especially good at.
 1. AI assissted in creating guidelines of how to layout code, especially when we were unfamiliar with the langauge or API. 
 2. AI could take code snippets we were having issues with and point out errors or potential revisions that went overlooked.
 3. AI helped us understand and work with each other's code when team members weren't avaible to immediately explain it. 

### At least 3 specific examples of how you had to be careful using AI to get good results or decided to avoid AI assistance entirely.
1. AI can get confused quickly, especially when handling a lot of information at once. We had to make sure to provide adequate context and narrower prompts to guide it to a suitable answer. 
2. Sometimes AI would over-optimize or make changes that were not requested. 
3. When trying to get certain parts of the program to work with each other (ex. Spotify API and the map), the AI wouldn't always understand what was already present/working and what was needed. This is when we tended to avoid it, or give it smaller tasks.
