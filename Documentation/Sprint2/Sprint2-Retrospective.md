# Sprint 2 - Retrospective

## What went well and what not? 
* __Not well__: 
    * We struggled with time management. Tasks were not worked on in a timely manner in some cases, due to underestimating the time and complexity. 
    * Our tasks sometimes bumped into each other and prevented or created new work for teammates on occasion. 
* __Well__: 
    * The project is now truly cohesive and everything is working with itself as intended, and it looks much more polished. 
    * We identified what needed to be done quicker and broke it down into better tasks to avoid putting too much work/edits into one ticket. 

* __Caden__ : I was able to do the majority of my work in the beginning of the sprint, this is good so I am not waiting until the last second to complete my work. I think that I was not communicating the state of the database and server application very well. I am not convinced the team knew exactly where we stand on any of that. 
* __Devin__ : Something that went well for me was being able to merge the webpages into one homepage to make the website less clunky. Something that didn't go as well was trying to mesh all the previous and current stylings into one fully formed design that stayed consistent with new additons. 
* __Jacob__ : I was able to create and implement a card that displays the current song that the current user logged in is listening to and implement a logout button that clears a users login. I struggled with my time management on this sprint and spreading out my work. I tackled all my task at once instead of one at a time, which is something I would like to improve on next sprint.
* __Leon__  : I was able to successfully complete the tasks assigned to me and implement the required code effectively. Throughout the process, I gained valuable insights into how MongoDB works and how to properly integrate it into our project. Communication within the team was not as effective as it could have been. There was some confusion regarding task assignments and overlapping responsibilities. Additionally, I recognized that I need to focus on writing cleaner, more reliable code to make collaboration easier for my teammates.
* __Mateo__ : Something that went well for me is that I was able to finish all of my tasks despite not managing my time better. Something that did not go well for me at all was the fact that I ran into a rebase error by not being up to date on the ongoing changes. As a result, two files in my changes did not commit or were not in my PR. I do have those files on hand, I will just have to apply those changes in the next sprint when I do a code cleanup/new tests for our database

## What might be impending us from performing better?
* Making sure group members fully understand what they are commiting to the code and ensuring it's not impacting others (to the best of their ability) before they add their changes. 

## What can I do to improve?
* __Caden__ : Improve my communication on my current status, and how it works. 
* __Devin__ : Keep more up to date with what other group members are working on/the new additions to account for on the webpage.
* __Jacob__ : I can improve my communication on my task on how code works to be sure I am not interfering any other team members code. 
* __Leon__  : I need to improve my communication with the team, especially when I encounter challenges or get stuck on parts of the code. By reaching out sooner and collaborating more openly, I can resolve issues more efficiently and ensure that my commits are cleaner, better structured, and easier for others to review.
* __Mateo__ : I can make sure I am up to date on changes made by the team and manage my time better as I was not able to properly balance the project, exams, homework, and other projects from other courses.

## AI
### Description of how AI (ChatGPT, Anthropic, Genesis, etc) assisted the team during the semester.
* AI assissted our team by providing a resource that could generate information and responses based directly on our project, not just general information. This made it useful and directly applicable to certain issues we encountered.
### At least 3 specific examples of what AI was especially good at.
 1. AI was really useful in making outlines and frameworks for how code will look.
 2. AI was also very effective on research and better understanding of the implementation of the pros and cons of tools like Mongodb and Firebase
 3. AI made it easier to understand teammates’ code and offered structured ideas for implementation.
 4. AI made it easier to identify edge cases, for testing and implementation.
### At least 3 specific examples of how you had to be careful using AI to get good results or decided to avoid AI assistance entirely.
1. Some things to consider is when to ask AI for help when it comes to clients information as well as what information we give it for our project.
2. AI sometimes produces incorrect or overly complex code that isn’t easy to maintain.
3. AI can over complicate some of the code and even confuse the developers perspective.
