# Sprint 3 - Retrospective

## AI
### Description of how AI (ChatGPT, Anthropic, Genesis, etc) assisted the team during the semester.
* AI assissted our team by providing a resource that could generate information and responses based directly on our project, not just general information. This made it useful and directly applicable to certain issues we encountered.
### At least 3 specific examples of what AI was especially good at.
 1. AI was really useful in making outlines and frameworks for how code will look.
 2. AI was also very effective on research and better understanding of the implementation of the pros and cons of tools like Mongodb and Firebase
 3. AI made it easier to understand teammates’ code and offered structured ideas for implementation.
 4. AI made it easier to identify edge cases, for testing and implementation.
### At least 3 specific examples of how you had to be careful using AI to get good results or decided to avoid AI assistance entirely.
1. Some things to consider is when to ask AI for help when it comes to clients information as well as what information we give it for our project.
2. AI sometimes produces incorrect or overly complex code that isn’t easy to maintain.
3. AI can over complicate some of the code and even confuse the developers perspective.

## Rebasing and Squashing
### What was good about rebasing only process?
* The tree looks way cleaner at the end of the sprint
### What was problematic and how could it be improved?
* I think it was easier to tell where all the old branches were, the rebasing hides alot of the process and makes it look like just a single line of changes.
* Squashing and force pushing invite potential for code to be lost if done incorrectly.
* Seems like what you really want is squash and merge, itll have a clean main with one commit, without hiding the complexity of the development process.
### How well did rebasing with squashing improve or worsen your ability to understand what your team's understanding of the state of the commits, branches and workflow?
* Helped a little, we now know what rebasing actually entails.
