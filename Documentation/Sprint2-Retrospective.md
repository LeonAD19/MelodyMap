# Sprint 1 - Retrospective

## What went well and what not? 
* __Not well__: 
    * We struggled with time management. Tasks were not worked on in a timely manner in some cases, due to underestimating the time and complexity. 
    * Our tasks sometimes bumped into each other and prevented or created new work for team mates on occasion. 
* __Well__: 
    * The project is now truly cohesive and everything is working with itself as intended, and it looks much more polished. 
    * We identified what needed to be done quicker and broke it down into better tasks to avoid putting too much work/edits into one ticket. 

* __Caden__ : 
* __Devin__ : Something that went well for me was being able to merge the webpages into one homepage to make the website less clunky. Something that didn't go as well was trying to mesh all the previous and current stylings into one fully formed design that stayed consistent with new additons. 
* __Jacob__ : 
* __Leon__  : 
* __Mateo__ : Something that went well for me is that I was able to finish all of my tasks despite not managing my time better. Something that did not go well for me at all was the fact that I ran into a rebase error by not being up to date on the ongoing changes. As a result, two files in my changes did not commit or were not in my PR. I do have those files on hand, I will just have to apply those changes in the next sprint when I do a code cleanup/new tests for our database

## What might be impending us from performing better?
* Making sure group members fully understand what they are commiting to the code and ensuring it's not impacting others (to the best of their ability) before they add their changes. 

## What can I do to improve?
* __Caden__ : 
* __Devin__ : Keep more up to date with what other group members are working on/the new additions to account for on the webpage.
* __Jacob__ : 
* __Leon__  : 
* __Mateo__ : I can make sure I am up to date on changes made by the team and manage my time better as I was not able to properly balance the project, exams, homework, and other projects from other courses.

## AI
### Description of how AI (ChatGPT, Anthropic, Genesis, etc) assisted the team during the semester.
*  
### At least 3 specific examples of what AI was especially good at.
 1. AI was really useful in making outlines and frameworks for how code will look.
 2. AI also helped explain how other people's cod worked if you were having to work with it directly. 
 3. 
### At least 3 specific examples of how you had to be careful using AI to get good results or decided to avoid AI assistance entirely.
