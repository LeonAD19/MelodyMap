# Sprint 1 - Retrospective

## What went well and what not? 
* __Not well__: 
    * We struggled with time management. Tasks were not worked on in a timely manner in some cases, due to underestimating the time and complexity. 
    * Our tasks sometimes bumped into each other and prevented or created new work for team mates on occasion. 
* __Well__: 
    * The project is now truly cohesive and everything is working with itself as intended, and it looks much more polished. 
    * We identified what needed to be done quicker and broke it down into better tasks to avoid putting too much work/edits into one ticket. 

* __Caden__ : 
* __Devin__ : Something that went well for me was being able to merge the webpages into one homepage to make the website less clunky. Something that didn't go as well was trying to mesh all the previous and current stylings into one fully formed design that stayed consistent with new additons.

## What might be impending us from performing better?
* Making sure group members fully understand what they are commiting to the code and ensuring it's not impacting others (to the best of their ability) before they add their changes. 

## What can I do to improve?
* __Caden__ : 
* __Devin__ : Keep more up to date with what other group members are working on/the new additions to account for on the webpage.
* __Jacob__ : 
* __Leon__  :

## AI
### Description of how AI (ChatGPT, Anthropic, Genesis, etc) assisted the team during the semester.
*  
### At least 3 specific examples of what AI was especially good at.
 1. AI was really useful in making outlines and frameworks for how code will look.
 2. AI also helped explain how other people's cod worked if you were having to work with it directly. 
 3. 
### At least 3 specific examples of how you had to be careful using AI to get good results or decided to avoid AI assistance entirely.
