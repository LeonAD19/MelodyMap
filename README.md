## 🎯 Description

**Who you’re working with**  
Team Members:  
- Mateo Salinas  
- Leon Altamirano  
- Devin Schupbach  
- Caden Sprague  
- Jacob Mora  

**What you’re creating**  
We are building a website where people around you can see what music you are listening to in real time. Beyond simply showing the current track, we aim to add unique features such as displaying which portion of a song someone is on. The website will integrate with both **Spotify** and **Apple Music**, and depending on how our sprints progress, we may also expand to a mobile app version.  

**Who you’re doing it for (your audience)**  
Our audience includes students, music enthusiasts, and everyday listeners who want to share and discover music with people nearby.  

**Why you’re doing this (the impact/change you hope to make)**  
We want to:  
- Help people discover new music.  
- Provide a platform to share music in a fun, interactive way.  
- Encourage social connection through music discovery while maintaining user privacy.

- **AI Tools**: [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/), and [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) to assist with debugging, formatting, and ideation.
